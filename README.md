CodeFurry 5.O Hackathon

- Problem Statement:
Start-ups are booming more than ever. The need for innovation, solutions are and will always be on a rise. But here's the issue,  many startups aren't growing due to a lack of funding, guidance and support. Develop a web/app which aims to solve the above problem. The solution must be to provide an environment which will support innovations by individuals(students and/or professionals alike).

- Solution:
startupwingsðŸš€
is a platform that supports startups. They can have the right environment and resources to grow and prosper with the right supervision and funding. However, as a result, more startups are emerging. Not every startup receives the attention it deserves. At StartupWings, we have developed a solution that gives a young startup the opportunity to introduce itself to potential investors while simultaneously seeking advice from mentors who want to support them. Our website has a section dedicated to investors and mentors, so they can see the businesses emerging in their areas of interest. This contact is a two-way process; both the mentors and the startups may see each other. So, in this manner, companies can receive any necessary help.
- Tech Stack Used
React JS, Material UI, Node JS, MongoDB
